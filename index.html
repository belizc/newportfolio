        <h2>Start Here</h2>
      <p>Hi friend! I'm Crisol Guadalupe Beliz, but most people call me Cris. I'm happy you're here. Feel free to stay a while to learn more about my experience with ASD on this page, look at some of my art on the "art" page, read about how cool turtles are on the "turtle" page,
        browse my resume on the "resume" page, or say hi on the "contact" page! </p>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Growing up I suffered from selective mutism, and found it difficult to connect to other people. I had a strong propensity for telling the truth, often to my own detriment, and reading. 
          Truth-telling and escapism proved counterproductive to social endeavours, but great for academic achievement. Once in sixth grade I received praise from teachers and classmates alike 
          for a portrait of a “Diana Monkey” I had drawn. When a fellow classmate lauded about how “dope” I was I angrily responded “YOU’RE DOPE!” in tears, having perceived the compliment as 
          a slight. 
        </p>

          <p>As an avid reader I was admitted to the top ranked school in Michigan (City High/Middle School), where I was encouraged to apply to college. To better understand the world around me I decided to study literature 
            and history via a liberal studies degree at Grand Valley State University (GVSU). However, as my education became more self-directed I struggled to keep up. I struggled through social 
            blunders galore, disorganization,  an impaired sense of time, and poor working memory. Working with a licensed neuropsychologist I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and was 
            connected to great resources.
          </p>
          <p>As a Latina with diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder I hope to leverage my data science background to advocate for social good.</p>
