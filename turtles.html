      <h2 class="turtleCity"> Akumal "The Place of Turtles"</h2>
      <p class="turtles">AkumaI is a city in Mexico known for it’s beautiful and vibrant sea green sea turtle population. I have been lucky enough to visit twice to swim with these wonderful animals. 
        While admiring them as they swam around me a local tour guide shared some interesting turtle facts. Inspired by this visit enjoy some of my favorite turtle 
        facts on this page that I have collected over time.

    <ol>
        <li>Turtles have an “Egg Tooth” which they use to crack their shells when hatching</li> 
        <li>Sea turtle gender is determined by the temperature of the nest, a warmer nest means more females will be born and a colder one means more males</li> 
        <li>Crush from "Finding Nemo" is a green sea turtle, they are known to occasionally dine on jellyfish but mostly subsist off of algae which is why they have a green hue</li>
        <li>A sea turtle's shell is called a carapace and it's actually part of their skeletal structure.</li>
        <li>Sea turtles cannot hide in their shells like other turtles, but luckily they have flippers that help them swim fast to escape predators</li>
